## Signal Analysis with Python - DFT -

# Periodic Signals
- A periodic signal is one that repeats at regular intervals of time. The frequency of a periodic signal indicates how many times the signal repeats in one second.

# Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- The DFT is a mathematical tool used to analyze the frequency components of a digital signal. It transforms a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain.

# Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- The FFT is an efficient algorithm for computing the DFT. It significantly reduces the computational complexity of the transformation.

# Visualizing Frequency Components
After computing the DFT or FFT of a signal, it's useful to visualize its frequency components to analyze the spectral content of the signal.
