## Harmonics

# Aliasing.py
- The Aliasing.py file generates two cosine signals with frequencies of 4500 Hz and 5500 Hz, respectively. These signals are then plotted using the matplotlib library.

# SquareWaves.py
- The SquareWaves.py file generates a square wave with a specified frequency, amplitude, and duration. The spectrum of the signal is computed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) from the scipy.fft library, and then the spectrum is plotted.

# TriangleWaves.py
- The TriangleWaves.py file generates a triangle wave with a specified frequency, amplitude, and duration. Similar to the square wave, the spectrum of the triangle wave is computed using the FFT from scipy.fft, and then the wave and its spectrum are plotted.
